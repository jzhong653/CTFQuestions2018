# CTFQuestions2018
<h1>Repo for CTF Questions for GenCyber Camp at UNO 2018</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
This repo is part of the collection of questions I designed for the UNO GenCyber CTF Challenge. Some of the challenges on here are also not in the CTF Challenge because some of them are incomplete and I was having troubles attempting to figure out how to code them. These are also not all the questions I made, in fact, most of the quiz questions I made will not be on this repo.
