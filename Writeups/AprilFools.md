<h1>April Fools</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>

The user must attempt to find out if the webpage and the supposed deal is true and justifiable or if it is actually a phishy webpage and a fraudulent deal. Depending on what the user thinks, they either put in the flag provided for if they think the webpage and deal is real or they see if they can find the hidden flag if they think the deal is fake.
<h2>Hint</h2>
Not everything is as it seems, some of the most secret things are done in open spaces and in public.
