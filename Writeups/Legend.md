<h1>The Legend</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The user is given a short story of background to the photo, then is given the following photo to find the flag hidden in it.
<img src="images/GhostlyEmu.png">
<h2>Hint</h2>
Would there ever be purple and blue grass in nature?
<h2>Solution</h2>
The user is suppose to recognize the photo is a faked photo and that the color of the photo has been inverted.

By inverting the photo back to its orignial state, the written text on the photo's bottom right becomes clear and the <b>flag{Australia_lost_to_emus}</b> is revealed.

Another solution the user could of explored was if they had noticed something wierd in the inverted photo's bottom right hand corner. They could then zoom in on the wierd spot and from there, they can also see the rough outline of the <b>flag{Australia_lost_to_emus}</b>.
