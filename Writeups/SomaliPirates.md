<h1>Somali Pirate Attack</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The user is given a graphic that is shown with lines and different angles. They are then requested based on that graphic to find the location of which the graphic contains based on the encrypted message.
<h2>Hints</h2>
How do ships communicate with each other with flags on the open ocean?
<h2>Solution</h2>
The user is suppose to get from the hints of which the question gave that the symbols being used on the graphic are flag signals. Based on that they can then decrypt the message to find a bunch of numbers based on the first symbol telling them that it is the numerical part of the encryption. This then shows them an absolute location with longitude and lattitude of the location of the pirate's next attack. This location will lead them to the <b>flag{Berbera}</b>.
